## Android Blog Reader App ðŸ“°

This project demonstrates a simple yet functional Android app that allows users to browse and read blog posts using Jetpack Compose and MVVM architecture. It fetches blog data from the [VRID Blog API](https://blog.vrid.in/) and displays it in a user-friendly, modern interface.

**Features:**

*   **Modern UI with Jetpack Compose:** Built using the latest declarative UI toolkit for Android.
*   **Clean Architecture (MVVM):** Separates UI, data, and business logic for maintainability and testability.
*   **API Integration with Retrofit:**  Fetches blog posts from a live API using Retrofit.
*   **Image Loading with Coil:**  Efficiently displays featured images for each blog post.
*   **Navigation:** Smoothly navigates between the list of blogs and individual post views.
*   **Pagination:** Supports loading additional posts as the user scrolls, improving performance.

**Getting Started:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**  `git clone https://github.com/ayush-sharmaa/Blog-App.git`
2.  **Open in Android Studio:** Import the project into Android Studio.
3.  **Build and Run:** Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.

**Key Concepts Demonstrated:**

*   **Jetpack Compose:** Declarative UI, state management, composable functions, and UI elements.
*   **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** Architectural pattern, data binding, ViewModel lifecycle.
*   **Retrofit:** Network requests, API integration, HTTP calls.
*   **Coil:** Image loading, asynchronous loading, image caching.
*   **Jetpack Compose Navigation:** Navigation between screens, passing parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Future Enhancements:** This app could be extended to include offline mode, error handling, and advanced UI features for a more polished user experience.
*   **Learning Resource:**  This project serves as a good starting point for learning Jetpack Compose, MVVM, and API integration in Android development.
